Today's my birthday **(yay!)**, and there's nothing I love doing more on my special day than making my world-famous double-stuffed chocolate chip cookies and sharing them with as many people as I can.

This time, I'm sharing them with you! These are super easy and quick to make, and great for dunking in milk, coffee, or your bevy of choice. Just... keep them away from me, unless you're prepared to get cleaned out ASAP.

**Ingredients**

- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted Irish butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup packed brown sugar (light or dark)
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk chocolate chips
- 1 cup dark chocolate chips

**Instructions**

1. Preheat your oven to 350F (180C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.
3. Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next. Add the vanilla extract and mix well.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt.
5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
6. Fold in both the milk chocolate chips and dark chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the cookie dough.
7. For extra flavor and texture, you can chill the dough in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. This step is optional but can enhance the flavor.
8. Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
9. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are golden but the centers are still soft. The cookies will continue to set as they cool.
10. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely, then enjoy!
