  These banana cream muffins are a perfect harmony of moist banana-infused batter, generously studded with creamy pockets of velvety banana custard. Each bite is a journey through layers of heavenly sweetness, accentuated by the tantalizing blend of ripe bananas and rich cream. Perfect for starting your day with a delightful breakfast treat or treating yourself to a midday pick-me-up.
