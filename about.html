  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m Katelyn, and I love to bake! Been doing it since I was yay big, and I
    don’t see myself stopping any time soon. My cookies, cakes, and pastries
    have been described as “transcendent,” “unreal,” and “OMG.” I have a great
    idea: I should cater your next event!
  </p>

    By day, I’m a mild-mannered Quabidy Assurance specialist. By night... I’m
    also mild-mannered, but with pyjamas on! Did I mention I love to bake? You
    can often find me with a whisk and mixing bowl in hand.

    The biggest thing for me is putting smiles on the faces of everyone who gets
    to sample my goodies. If my baking skill was a D&D character stat, I’d
    probably be maxed at 20. Extra points if you know what I'm talking about.

    I believe there’s a baked confection for every special occasion. Let me help
    you find yours!
